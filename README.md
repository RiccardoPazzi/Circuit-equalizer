# Circuit-equalizer
## Simple equalization circuit specified using VHDL
### 🎯 The objective was to code a simple circuit for equalization of black & white images
### 💡 The solution implements a finite state machine to equalize the image in a sequential manner
### 🛠️ The software used is Xilinx Vivado

The documentation file contains an explanation of the specs, how the circuit was implemented and which benchmark tests were performed to ensure the component worked properly.
The component was tested using both the behavioural and physical synthetizations.
